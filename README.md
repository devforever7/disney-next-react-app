- **TypeScript** - Type safety and enhanced developer experience
- **React Query** - Client state management and caching

### Performance Features

- **Rendering Optimizations**

  - Server-side rendering for character profile pages and some for home page
  - Static generation for featured content
  - Debounced search with client-side caching

- **Image Optimization**
  - Prefer AVIF format (50-90% smaller than JPEG)
  - WebP fallback support
  - Above-the-fold priority loading for character profile pages
  - Lazy loading for grid content

### User Interface

### Follow-up

- Add more tests
- Add pagination to search results
- Move `<nav />` element outside of `<main/>` tag (`NavMenu` component)
- Ensure `NavMenu` traps focus within itself when open
- Create `Navigation` component in `components/layout` directory to handle navigation, and to consolidate `NavMenu` and `SearchBar` components.
